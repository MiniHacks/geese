### quickstart on how to use python

(note: probably, you should just use docker if you are just trying to get this deployed)

---

The following steps assume that your current working directory is inside the 
`pyth/` folder

1. Set up a venv 
   
   ```console
   python3 -m venv venv/
   ```

2. use the venv
   ```console
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   or, for `fish` shell,
   ```console
   source venv/bin/activate.fish
   ```

3. run the program

   ```console
   python3 -m python_backend
   ```
